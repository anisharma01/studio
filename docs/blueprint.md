- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF5FB), a desaturated tone of the primary, offers a gentle backdrop that's easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: A subtle lavender (#A391BF), sitting between blue and pink on the color wheel, complements the blue tones while adding a touch of sophistication and modernity.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text due to its modern, neutral appearance, which ensures readability and accessibility.
- Use simple, outlined icons for folders, files, and links to maintain a clean and intuitive interface.
- A clean, card-based layout will organize and display information efficiently, aiding quick scanning.
- Subtle transitions and animations for folder opening, file uploads, and search results to provide visual feedback and enhance user experience.
